Scalping Plan

- Assets: BTCUSDT, ETHUSDT, SOLUSDT
- Leverage: 10x (fixed)
- Position Size: 2% of capital per asset
- Risk-Reward Ratio: 1:2 + trailing stop after reaching target
- Profit Factor Target: > 2.3
- Max Drawdown Limit: < 8%
- Risk Management:
	- Risking 2% per trade with 10x leverage, strict stop-losses.
	- Trailing stop after reaching 2× risk allows capturing extended moves.
	- Daily loss limit recommendation: maximum 3%–4% of total capital to avoid tilt.
- Notes:
	- Scalping only top 3 coins ensures liquidity and better execution.
	- 10x leverage is aggressive but acceptable with strict discipline.
	- Maintaining a 2.3+ Profit Factor confirms system profitability even after fees.
	- Keeping max drawdown under 8% protects long-term survival.
	- Win rate target (unofficial but helpful): 65%–75%.
- Recalculate Position size Every 2 Weeks
	- Why it is good:
		- Scalping is high-frequency, so 2 weeks usually means 30–80 trades (depending on your activity).
		- It is enough trades to smooth out randomness (lucky or unlucky streaks).
		- Recalculating after 2 weeks prevents wild position size jumps.
		- Keeps your risk per trade clean and consistent.
	- ✅ Result:
		- Every 2 weeks, you adjust your position size slightly based on the real balance.
		- Your 1:2 risk-reward ratio stays stable.
		- Your risk stays proportional to your account growth.
