1. Key building blocks

Component
What it tells you
Signals to watch
Tunable knobs
HyperWave
Noise-filtered momentum & trend bias
• Color band (above/below signal line)• Turning-point dots (green ↑ / red ↓)• Size-up dots when cross happens in OB > 80 / OS < 20• Auto bullish/bearish divergence lines
Main Length (trend vs speed)Signal-line algo (SMA = smooth, TS = snappy)Divergence Sensitivity %  ([HyperWave Feature
Smart Money Flow (SMF)
Longer-cycle liquidity & “big-player” activity
• SMF line slope & 50-level bias• Upper / lower threshold breaks (heavy one-sided flow)• Overflow flags when liquidity spikes late in a trend
Show/Hide Money Flow, Overflow toggle ([Smart Money Flow
Reversal Signals
Pattern-scored turning points
• Minor “–” circles → brief pullbacks• Major “+” triangles → trend-scale reversals
no extra inputs; inherits HyperWave/SMF context ([Reversal Signals
Confluence
How many elements agree
• Upper (bull) & lower (bear) Confluence Zones shade 0 / 1 / 2 strength• Numeric Confluence Meter 0-100
Outputs can feed alerts or scripts ([Confluence
Alerts & Custom Alert Creator
Converts any mix of the above into TradingView alerts (or JSON for webhooks)
Pre-set triggers (e.g., “HyperWave OB Signal Down”, “Strong Bullish Confluence”) or multi-step custom logic
Any-alert() list, step/OR/Invalidate operators, placeholder tokens ([Alerts

2. Applying the toolkit


A. Scalp-oriented blueprint (1 m – 5 m)

Goal
Practical checklist
Catch micro bursts
• Set Main Length low (e.g., 4-8) so HyperWave flips quickly.• Enter with the first green/red turning-point dot inside Confluence Zone = 2.• Trim/exit when SMF line slams into an Overflow or opposite threshold – that often precedes a momentum stall.• Minor “–” reversal dots against your position → scale out or tighten stop.• Alerts: “Any-alert() → HyperWave Signal Up/Down” plus “Bullish/Bearish Overflow” so the bot can react within one candle.

B. Swing-oriented blueprint (4 h – 1 D)

Goal
Practical checklist
Ride multi-day legs
• Increase Main Length (e.g., 20-34) for smoother HyperWave cycles.• Look for Major “+” reversal triangles that coincide with SMF crossing back through its 50-line and a Confluence Meter > 70 – that trio often marks trend inflection.• Hidden divergences on pullbacks (HyperWave rising while price makes a higher low) give continuation add-ons.• Overflow after a prolonged run is an early exit clue; wait for Confluence to fade from 2 → 1 before closing.• Set long-interval alerts (“HyperWave OB/OS Signal Down/Up”, “Strong Bearish/Bullish Confluence”) to free you from screen-watching.

4. Workflow suggestion

1. Template the indicator once → duplicate layouts for scalp vs swing with the settings above.
2. Build alerts last – start with pre-sets, then migrate to Custom Alert Creator when your rule-set is final.
3. Log every trade + the Matrix states so you can quantify which combo (e.g., dot + Confluence 2 + no Overflow) actually yields edge before automating further.


🚀 Blueprint #1: Scalping (1–15 min)


📌 Objective:

Capture short-term momentum bursts and quick reversals with minimal noise.

⚙️ Optimal Settings:

- HyperWave Main Length: 5–8
- Signal Line: Trailing Stop (TS) (faster reaction)
- Divergence Sensitivity: 80–90% (clear & reliable divergences only)
- Overflow: Enabled (profit-taking signals)

✅ Entry Criteria:

- HyperWave turning-point dot (green for long, red for short).
- Confirm with immediate Confluence Zone level 2 (strong agreement).
- Optional: Quick Minor Reversal "–" circles after pullbacks as add-on signals.

🔴 Exit Criteria:

- Overflow warning (early exit/scale-out).
- Opposite turning-point dot appears.
- Confluence dropping from level 2 to 0 or 1 signals weakening momentum.

🚨 Alerts to Set:

- HyperWave turning-point dots (Signal Up/Down)
- Bullish/Bearish Overflow events
- Minor reversal signals

🌊 Blueprint #2: Swing Trading (4 h–1 D)


📌 Objective:

Identify medium-to-long-term trend reversals and momentum continuations.

⚙️ Optimal Settings:

- HyperWave Main Length: 20–34 (for smoother signals)
- Signal Line: Simple Moving Average (SMA) (less noise)
- Divergence Sensitivity: 40–60% (capture broader divergences)
- Overflow: Enabled (trend exhaustion warning)

✅ Entry Criteria:

- Major reversal "+" triangle signal aligns with:
	- HyperWave crossing signal line (turning-point dot).
	- SMF crossing 50-level bullish (upward) or bearish (downward).
	- Confluence Meter > 70 (strong agreement across matrix).
- Hidden divergences during pullbacks confirm trend continuation entries.

🔴 Exit Criteria:

- Overflow warning after prolonged run (prepare exit).
- Opposite major reversal "+" triangle signals new trend direction.
- Confluence weakening significantly (level 2 dropping sharply to 0/1).

🚨 Alerts to Set:

- HyperWave OB/OS turning-point signals (overbought/oversold crosses)
- Strong bullish/bearish Confluence signals
- Major reversal signals (+ triangles)
- SMF crossing above/below 50-level threshold
