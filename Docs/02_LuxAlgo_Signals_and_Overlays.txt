LuxAlgo Signals & Overlays 


---

1. What the toolkit gives you

A single TradingView indicator that bundles two algorithmic signal engines, five overlay-style helpers, automatic TP/SL plotting, adaptive candle colours, a dashboard, and an alert builder. It is meant to confirm or fade price moves rather than fire blind entries.  (Intro | Signals & Overlays Toolkit | LuxAlgo)

2. Core signal engines

Engine
Purpose
Variants
Built-in exits
Notes
Confirmation
Trend-following continuation
Normal & Strong (+)
Blue (bullish) / orange (bearish) crosses
Works best when filtered with overlays ([Signal Modes
Contrarian
Top / bottom hunting
Normal & Strong (+)
Same crosses
Faster but riskier; can also serve as alternative exits ([Signal Modes
ML Classifier (optional) stamps every signal 1-4: low numbers hint at exhaustion, high numbers at momentum. You can hide any numbers you dislike.  (Signal Modes | Signals & Overlays | LuxAlgo)

3. Tuning the signals

- Sensitivity (one slider for both engines)
	- 5-10 → short-term price swings
	- 12 (default) → medium swings
	- 20 + → long trends  (Signal Settings | Signals & Overlays | LuxAlgo)
- Autopilot – lets the algorithm self-adjust to market regime; you can bias it with an “Autopilot Sensitivity” number.  (Signal Settings | Signals & Overlays | LuxAlgo)
- Dashboard “Optimal Sensitivity” – grid-searches the last 250 bars (sens. 10-20) and prints the best value; update it periodically.  (Signal Settings | Signals & Overlays | LuxAlgo)

4. Overlay arsenal (toggle any mix)

Overlay
What it shows
Typical use
Smart Trail
Adaptive trailing stop + S/R ribbons
Trend direction, stop placement ([Indicator Overlays
Reversal Zones
Dynamic upper / lower bands
Overbought/oversold, profit targets ([Indicator Overlays
Trend Tracer
Smoother trend filter
Confluence for confirmation signals ([Indicator Overlays
Trend Catcher
Earlier, faster trend detector
Early entry or overlay-fired TP/SL ([Indicator Overlays
Neo Cloud
Ichimoku-like cloud
Long-horizon trend & S/R ([Indicator Overlays

---

5. Automatic TP / SL plotting

Choose one trigger (Signals, Smart Trail, Reversal Zones, Trend Catcher, Trend Tracer, Neo Cloud, or a Custom Alert). Four levels are projected; “Distance” moves them closer/farther.  (TP/SL | Signals & Overlays | LuxAlgo)
---

6. Candle colouring (quick visual state)

- Confirmation Simple (default):
	- Green = strong bull, Red = strong bear, Purple = normal  (Candle Coloring | Signals & Overlays | LuxAlgo)
- Confirmation Gradient – intensity reflects momentum/retracement.
- Contrarian Gradient – intensity reflects oversold/overbought.
---

7. Alerts — from one-click to script-like sequences

- Pre-sets cover every signal/overlay event (e.g., “Any Bullish +”).  (Alerts | Signals & Overlays | LuxAlgo)
- Any alert() function lets you chain multiple conditions.
- Custom Alert Creator supports multi-step logic with Step / OR / All / Invalidate operators, max-bar intervals, placeholders for price, TP/SL, etc.  (Alerts | Signals & Overlays | LuxAlgo)

Applying it: scalping vs. swing

Component
Scalp Strategy (1-5 min)
Swing Strategy (4 h – D)
Sensitivity
5-10 or Autopilot low-bias for more signals
12–20 + or dashboard optimal for fewer, cleaner signals
Preferred engine
Contrarian for quick fades; Confirmation + for micro-trend follow
Confirmation + for trend rides; Contrarian only for major reversals
Filter
Strong (+) only, ML scores 3-4 to cut noise
Add Trend Tracer/Neo Cloud alignment
Overlay help
Smart Trail + Reversal Zones for tight dynamic S/L & exit
Trend Tracer/Neo Cloud for bias; Reversal Zones for adds or exits
TP/SL
Use Signals trigger, small “Distance”, aim at TP1
Use overlay-based trigger (e.g., Smart Trail), pyramid TP1-TP3
Alerts
Optional: ping Strong + or TP/SL hit while monitoring many pairs
Essential: alert on Strong +, overlay flips, or custom multi-step conditions

✅ Blueprint 1: Scalping (1–15 min)


⚙️ Signal Settings:

- Sensitivity: 5–10 (Lower = more signals)
- Mode: Autopilot (Bias towards shorter-term)

🔄 Signal Engine:

- Primary: Contrarian Signals (quick reversals)
	- Priority: Strong (+) signals only
	- ML Classifier: Use ratings 3–4 only
- Secondary: Confirmation Signals (Strong (+)) for micro-trend continuation scalps

📊 Overlays:

- Smart Trail: Active stop-loss/trend confirmation
- Reversal Zones: Entry confirmations, profit-taking areas

🎯 TP/SL Levels:

- Trigger Source: Signals-based
- Distance Setting: Small (tight SL, quick TP)
- Target Level: TP1 primarily

🕯 Candle Colouring:

- Confirmation Simple Mode: Immediate momentum check (Green/Red/Purple)

🛎 Alerts (Optional):

- Strong Contrarian/Confirmation signals for multi-asset monitoring

🚦 Quick Entry Checklist:

1. Strong (+) Contrarian or Confirmation signal
2. ML Classifier rated 3–4
3. Candle Colour aligned (Green buy / Red sell)
4. Close proximity to Reversal Zone boundary or Smart Trail
---

✅ Blueprint 2: Swing Trading (4H–1D)


⚙️ Signal Settings:

- Sensitivity: 12–20+ (Higher = clearer signals)
- Mode: Autopilot (Bias towards longer-term)

🔄 Signal Engine:

- Primary: Confirmation Signals for trend riding
	- Priority: Strong (+) signals only

- Secondary: Contrarian Signals cautiously (major trend reversals only)

📊 Overlays:

- Trend Tracer: Trend confirmation
- Neo Cloud: Long-term trend alignment, S/R confirmation
- Reversal Zones: Optimal entry/exit targets

🎯 TP/SL Levels:

- Trigger Source: Smart Trail or Neo Cloud-based
- Distance Setting: Medium (balanced SL/TP distance)
- Target Levels: TP1–TP3 (scale out positions)
