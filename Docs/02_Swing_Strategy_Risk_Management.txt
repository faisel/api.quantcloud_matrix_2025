Swing Trading Plan

- Assets: BTCUSDT, ETHUSDT, SOLUSDT
- Leverage: 1x (spot/futures with minimal margin)
- Position Size: 3% of capital per asset
- Risk-Reward Ratio: 1:2 + trailing stop after reaching target
- Profit Factor Target: > 1.8
- Max Drawdown Limit: < 12%
- Risk Management:
	- Risk per trade is lower because of no heavy leverage.
	- Trailing stops capture big moves while locking in partial profits.
	- Monthly loss limit recommendation: maximum 10%–12% to stay in control.
- Notes:
	- 1x leverage is ideal to handle overnight gaps and high volatility safely.
	- 1:2 Risk-Reward is perfect for medium-term crypto moves.
	- Profit Factor of 1.8+ ensures you remain profitable even with a lower win rate (~45–55%).
	- Max drawdown under 12% keeps account volatility low enough for smooth growth.
- Recalculate Position size Every 2 Months
	- Why it is good:
		- Swing trading is low-frequency (few trades per month).
		- Positions stay open for days to weeks.
		- Recalculating too often for swing trades is not needed and could distort the risk-reward.
		- 2 months is enough time to have 6–12 trades to analyze performance.
	- ✅ Result:
		- Every 2 months, you slightly adjust position size based on new account balance.
		- Your risk stays predictable and does not react to short-term noise.
		- Reduces psychological stress (important for holding swing trades comfortably).
