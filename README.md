#### -------- LuxAlgo BullMatrix

Need a Algo Main Switch, if this OFF, nothing do with AlgoAlert 

Take trade based on LuxAlgo trategy 15mchart with alert, means higher timeframes which can go up to our tp4 percentage 
after touch tp3, if comes down, need a solution or let it like now

Focus on Hedge
make hedge more longer,
if no hedge triggered by luxalgo signal, then take the hedge as per the plan

after taking the hedge, if luxalgo make a strong signal (we need to finetune a strong signal only for hedge protect)
close the hedge with loss or with profit, just colse it.


make sure
open / close hedge button is working properly

--- Dev
get the algo alert, process it and save to DB
get the indicator slert, process it and save to DB
get the Sentimental analyis with Perplexity, process it and save to DB
get the Sentimental analyis with OpenAI, process it and save to DB

all dased on different timeframes, and make final decision

# New ToDo

-> app/models/model_positions.py -  async def update_matrix_positions_index_dynamic  - Done  âœ…
    # Build the update expression
    update_expression = "SET " + ", ".join([f"{key} = :{key}" for key in updates.keys()])
    expression_attribute_values = {f":{key}": value for key, value in updates.items()}
    Here we need to  make a check, if the key is "isOrderOpen", then check the value if the value is boolean then convert in to Int , only possible 0 or 1

-> config_hedge_finish_level_percentage	3.7
config_hedge_margin_percentage	2.8
Gdrive Excel current trade we need to work on it

-> Issue for Hedge,
if hedge closed manually, we need to set a flag, because if i close, if the price is above the hedge line, it will execute hedge immediatly , we need a solution here

-> Hedge matrix
if open_position_with_symbol_final_data_final["emergency_close_level"] > 0:
we need one more flag for each symbol, now its check for all symbols

-> After reenter the TPS, the Entry value changes, so in between we need to recalculate

above_tp4_long - if hedge is open, make sure there is no opposite symbol is open, and create new entry with opposite symbol and type
hedge return to home - need a solution here
write down a user manual to ride the trade
Test all functions -  then ready

-> need a token baseed Main switch for each token to stop and run

-> Hedge should able to move based on ongoing strategy change, when changed, recalculate 






#### Features Final ####
#### Strategy Starts ####

HedgeRecovery - If the hedge is open and cannot close it, increase the LONG position size to protect the Hedge Position

TP4 (only if no hedge is open, Close & Take Profit - If hedge is open, dont close the TP4)
TP3 (Take Profit and reenter previous TP, only if the ReenterPilot (Example TrendRiversal, then manually disable the button) is eneabled)
TP2 (Take Profit and reenter previous TP, only if the ReenterPilot (Example TrendRiversal, then manually disable the button) is eneabled)
TP1 (Take Profit and reenter previous TP, only if the ReenterPilot (Example TrendRiversal, then manually disable the button) is eneabled)
Entry (Manual)

StopLossHedge - SLH (Anyway take the oposite hedge position, if there is no opened hedge position, also an option to take hedge position manually)

HedegeFinish - HFinsh If the hedge profit is equal to Position Loss, just close all and finish the game, Also manual option to finish game

ReturnToHome - RTH (Only if no hedge is open, if the capital is less than 10% close all trades and save last 10%)

-------
Now we develop only
TPs and reentry
Entry with calculations (Manual)
Hedge Manual (If the trend is reversal)
Hedge Automatic (Worst case) StopLossHedge

AutoNewTradeSwitch

Set ProfitForecast

* Between Entry & TP4
If trend reversal (15min) confirmed, close with profit

* Between StopLossHedge & Entry
Dynamically enter and close hedge
If trend reversal (15min) confirmed, recalculate, open hedge and update all values include HedegeFinish
If hedge is open and trend reversal confirmed against open hedge, check if the loss is less than ProfitForecast, then close the hedge, check if the loss is greater than ProfitForecast, then open ETh with current trend

* Between HedegeFinish & StopLossHedge
If the trend reversal confirmed and if hedge is in profit, close the hedge, and calculate the profit and close the entry position partially with the amount of hedge profit and wait for next hedge trend


* RTH :  when take trade Entry/Hedge - create an order calculated last 10% close order

* New Entry :  If 1D, 4H, 1H, 15m, 5m trend is same, If AI give sthe signal, If AutoNewTradeSwitch is ON, create new position


* After hedge open, if trend reversal (5min) confirmed, take ETH trade do the scalping with 30 sec open/Close



 #### Need to make a research
 if Sentiment Analysis / News based alert, then check for if all trades in profit, then close it
 if ATR is high volotile than above normal, if the positions is in profit, add a trailing stop order

# Indicator Priority List
    Priority 1 includes widely used and generally reliable indicators such as RSI, MACD, EMA, SMA, Bollinger Bands, ADX, Stochastic Oscillator, and Ichimoku Cloud.
    Priority 2 lists indicators that are commonly used and trusted, including CCI, MFI, Williams %R, PPO, ROC, and various stochastic oscillators.
    Priority 3 contains indicators that are useful but may require more careful interpretation, such as APO, Aroon, BOP, CMF, and various volume and momentum indicators.
    Priority 4 includes pattern recognition indicators, which can be less reliable and may produce more false signals, such as various candlestick patterns.
    Priority 5 lists mathematical operators and less commonly used transforms, which are not typically used as standalone indicators but rather as components in more complex calculations.



Rating the 10 price prediction methods is challenging as their effectiveness can vary depending on the specific market, timeframe, and trading style. However, I can provide a general assessment based on their popularity and typical effectiveness:

    Trend Analysis: 8/10 - Fundamental and widely used.
    Momentum Analysis: 7/10 - Very popular and often effective.
    Volume Analysis: 7/10 - Provides important context to price movements.
    Volatility Analysis: 7/10 - Useful for understanding market conditions.
    Price Action Pattern Analysis: 6/10 - Can be powerful but subjective.
    Sentiment Analysis: 6/10 - Potentially valuable but hard to quantify.
    Harmonic Analysis: 5/10 - Can be effective but complex.
    Wave Analysis: 5/10 - Potentially powerful but subjective.
    Intermarket Analysis: 6/10 - Valuable for understanding broader market context.
    Position & Risk Analysis: 8/10 - Critical for managing trades effectively.

As for combinations with a higher chance of accurate prediction, integrating multiple types of analysis often yields better results. Some effective combinations include:

    Trend Analysis + Momentum Analysis + Volume Analysis:
    This combination helps confirm trends and identify potential reversals. For example, using EMAs with RSI and CMF can provide a comprehensive view of price direction, momentum, and buying/selling pressure.
    Volatility Analysis + Price Action Pattern Analysis:
    Combining these can help identify high-probability trade setups. For instance, using Bollinger Bands with candlestick patterns can signal potential breakouts or reversals.
    Trend Analysis + Intermarket Analysis + Sentiment Analysis:
    This combination provides a broader market context. Using EMAs on correlated assets along with sentiment indicators can offer insights into potential market moves.
    Momentum Analysis + Harmonic Analysis + Position & Risk Analysis:
    This combination can help identify entry and exit points while managing risk. For example, using MACD with Harmonic Patterns and Fibonacci retracements can provide a structured approach to trading.
    Trend Analysis + Volatility Analysis + Volume Analysis:
    This combination is effective for identifying trending markets and potential reversals. Using Parabolic SAR with Bollinger Bands and On-Balance Volume can provide a comprehensive view of market dynamics.

Remember, no combination guarantees accurate predictions. It's important to 





Best range of candles for Fibonacci retracement 
General Guidelines for Candle Ranges:

    5 Candles (Short-term Analysis):
        Best for: Intraday or scalping strategies, very short-term trades.
        Pros: Responds quickly to recent price movements and can help identify short-term pullbacks or bounces.
        Cons: Prone to false signals due to small sample size and high market noise.

    10 Candles (Short to Medium-term Analysis):
        Best for: Short-term swing trades or identifying short-term retracement levels in a trending market.
        Pros: A good balance between responsiveness and stability. Reduces some noise compared to 5 candles but still captures short-term price action.
        Cons: Might still react to short-term volatility, which can lead to some noise.

    20 Candles (Medium-term Analysis):
        Best for: Swing trading and capturing medium-term trends and retracements.
        Pros: Provides a more stable and reliable retracement level, capturing more significant market movements and filtering out short-term noise.
        Cons: May lag in highly volatile markets or miss short-term opportunities.

    50 Candles (Longer-term Analysis):
        Best for: Long-term traders and investors who want to identify key levels over a larger time horizon.
        Pros: Captures a broader trend and identifies major support and resistance levels. Less prone to noise and market fluctuations.
        Cons: Slower to react to recent price action and might miss short-term trading opportunities.

Final Solutions

Identify the trend reversal

Partial Position Close


    1-hour (H1) Timeframe:
        This will help you track the short-term trend and identify key support and resistance levels around your entry and take-profit targets.
        Ideal for monitoring price fluctuations at a more granular level to refine your entries and exits.

    4-hour (H4) Timeframe:
        This timeframe is good for identifying the broader trend and possible price reversals.
        Use it to confirm the overall market direction and ensure your trades are aligned with the prevailing trend.

    15-minute (M15) Timeframe:
        For more precise trade entries and to spot short-term price action, especially when you are nearing your take-profit or stop-loss levels.
        This will help you make quicker decisions when the price approaches important levels like TP1-TP4 or SLH.

Why Multiple Timeframes?

    1-hour (H1) for refining and making trade decisions based on more detailed recent price movements.
    4-hour (H4) to confirm that the broader trend aligns with your trade direction.
    15-minute (M15) for precise timing, especially around your entry and exit points, and to manage risk effectively.



    Look for breakouts, momentum bursts, or quick pullbacks within an established intraday trend.
    Be nimble and quick to take profits. Don't hold intraday trades too long.
    Keep an eye on the 1-hour chart for key intraday support/resistance levels.

Additionally, pay attention to high-volatility trading sessions like the New York open (8-11 AM EST) and London close (11AM-2PM EST).1
These times often see bigger price movements and trading opportunities.


Breakout Strategy
    Timeframe: 15-minute (M15), 1-hour (H1) charts
    Objective: Capitalize on significant price moves after breaking key support or resistance levels.


Use indicators like Bollinger Bands, RSI, or Volume to confirm the breakout.

How it works:
    Identify overbought/oversold conditions with RSI or Bollinger Bands.
    Enter trades when the price moves outside of the normal range (e.g., above the upper Bollinger Band for a sell, or below the lower band for a buy).







Hedge Strategy (Directional Hedging)

    Timeframe: 1-hour (H1) or higher
    Objective: Hedge positions to minimize risk during market uncertainty.
    How it works:
        Open both long and short positions in BTCUSDT with smaller sizes.
        As the price moves in either direction, you can close one side of the trade and ride the remaining trade to profitability.
    Risk Management: Leverage can increase the cost of holding two positions. Consider using this strategy only when volatility is expected, and close trades quickly when the market picks a clear direction.




Suggested Timeframes:

    1-minute (M1) and 5-minute (M5) charts for scalping and short-term strategies.
    15-minute (M15) to 1-hour (H1) charts for momentum and breakout trading.
    Daily (D1) or 4-hour (H4) charts to confirm larger trends and avoid noise.




Entry Criteria:
    Enter long positions when the 15-minute chart shows a bounce off support within an uptrend identified on the 4-hour chart.
    Enter short positions when the 15-minute chart shows a rejection from resistance within a downtrend identified on the 4-hour chart.



Summary of Potential BTCUSDT Reversal Ranges per Timeframe:
    M5: ~$50 to $150
    M15: ~$100 to $300
    H1: ~$300 to $600
    H4: ~$500 to $1,000+
    D1: ~$1,000 to $2,500+


However, here are some general guidelines for estimating potential price targets after a trend reversal:
Fibonacci Retracement Levels
Fibonacci retracement levels (38.2%, 50%, 61.8%) are commonly used to identify potential support and resistance levels after a trend reversal6
.

    In an uptrend reversal, the price may retrace to these Fibonacci levels before continuing its upward movement.
    In a downtrend reversal, the price may bounce off these levels as it starts a new uptrend.

The distance between the reversal point and the nearest Fibonacci level can give you an idea of the minimum expected price movement.
Pivot Points
Pivot points (support and resistance levels) can also provide potential price targets5
. If the price breaks through a key pivot level after a reversal, it may continue moving until it reaches the next significant pivot level.

    For an uptrend reversal, look at resistance levels R1, R2, R3 as potential targets.
    For a downtrend reversal, look at support levels S1, S2, S3.

The distance between pivot levels can give you an estimate of potential price movement ranges.
Average True Range (ATR)
The Average True Range (ATR) indicator measures an asset's volatility. You can use a multiple of the ATR value to estimate potential price targets4
. For example, if the current ATR value is $100 on the H4 timeframe, and the price reverses from a downtrend to an uptrend, you could set a target of 2 x ATR ($200) above the reversal point.




Profitable 30-second trading strategy:
Multi-Timeframe Analysis

    Use higher timeframes (e.g. 1-hour, 15-minute) to identify the overall market trend and key levels1
    Confirm entries on lower timeframes like the 5-minute or 1-minute chart1
    Use the 30-second chart for precise entry timing, looking for specific price action patterns like Fair Value Gaps (FVGs)1

Indicators and Tools

    Utilize the Relative Strength Index (RSI) and Stochastic oscillators with customized settings for the 30-second timeframe2

    For the Stochastic, set the %K period to 5, %D period to 3, and overbought/oversold levels to 70/30
    For the RSI, set the period to 10 and overbought/oversold levels to 70/30 (or 80/20 for higher accuracy but fewer signals)

Look for specific candlestick patterns and price action, such as pullbacks within a trend3
Consider the Average Directional Index (ADX) to confirm there is enough momentum to enter a trade3



Adaptability: APIs like GPT-4 can be instructed with additional context such as news, sentiment analysis, or macroeconomic data, which can add value to pure technical analysis.
