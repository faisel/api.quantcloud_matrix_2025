# 🚀 QuantCloud Matrix: BTC-alpha + Dynamic ETH/SOL Hedge

# Project Overview Documentation

Last updated: April 2025
🧭 1. Introduction

QuantCloud Matrix is an advanced, automated, high-frequency scalping system designed for Binance Futures. Utilizing LuxAlgo Premium indicators integrated with TradingView, real-time signals are executed via a FastAPI-based backend, managing precision entries and exits on BTCUSDT while dynamically hedging correlated altcoins (ETHUSDT, SOLUSDT) to enhance risk management and profitability.
🎯 2. Goals & Objectives

    Primary Goal:

        Achieve stable monthly returns (≥20–30%) through systematic scalping.

    Objectives:

        Maintain high win-rate (60–70%) with Risk:Reward (R:R ≥ 0.9 : 1).

        Implement dynamic hedging strategies (ETH, SOL) for portfolio stability.

        Achieve ultra-low latency trade execution (25–60 ms).

        Maintain exceptional risk control, limiting drawdowns (<2.5R/day).

-------------

# Direction metrics
• Start logging win‑rate, PF, and avg R separately for longs vs shorts.
• Auto‑flag if either side’s PF < 1.2 over 500 trades.

Direction breaker already set (max_same_side_loss_R = ‑3).
This pauses only the losing side for the day and keeps the other side live.

Funding monitor
• Ping funding API every 10 min.
• If you’re short and funding > 0.08 %, cap hold‑time to 15 min.

🔍 How the Strategy Works — Step-by-Step
✅ 1. BTC triggers signal

Via your LuxAlgo system on the 3m chart:

    Premium/discount + OB tap + oscillator matrix + confirmation

    Direction: LONG or SHORT

✅ 2. BTC trade is sized and entered

Risk = 0.5% of current equity
Entry = limit or market depending on CVD
SL = OB low/high − 0.75 × ATR
TP = 1R, then AI SuperTrend trailing
✅ 3. Calculate Hedge β for ETH and SOL

Use rolling 1‑hour correlation:

beta_eth = Cov(returns_btc, returns_eth) / Var(returns_btc)
beta_sol = Cov(returns_btc, returns_sol) / Var(returns_btc)

    If BTC Long → Short ETH & SOL

    If BTC Short → Long ETH & SOL

    Size hedge = beta × BTC size × hedge_ratio (0.5–0.7)

✅ 4. Open ETH/SOL Hedge Legs

    Hedge positions should be market-neutral

    Entry = limit preferred (to earn maker rebates)

    SL = wider buffer (0.9 × ATR), no TP — exit when BTC closes

    Watch funding — prefer hedge in direction that earns funding

✅ 5. Close all positions on exit condition

    BTC hits TP or SL

    Time-based close (e.g., 30 min timeout)

    Immediately close hedge legs to lock in net PnL

✅ 6. Risk Management Logic

    Max 0.5% risk per position

    Shared drawdown breaker: pause if equity drops > 6R from 20-day high

    Directional breaker: pause LONG or SHORT if that side loses 3R

    Latency-aware sizing: auto-reduce risk if latency > 350 ms

1  Head‑to‑head: “Triple‑Alpha” vs “BTC‑Alpha + Alt‑Hedge”
Dimension	Triple‑Alpha<br>(BTC + ETH + SOL trade full‑duplex)	BTC‑Alpha + Dynamic ETH/SOL Hedge
Core logic	Each pair runs the full Lux‑Algo rule‑set; positions can be in any combination.	Only BTC fires the alpha signal; ETH & SOL open inverse hedge legs sized by rolling β (30 – 90 min).
Gross trade flow (3 m TF, live stats)	~11–14 trades/day	6–8 total legs/day (1 BTC leg + 1‑2 hedges)
Expected monthly PnL on 50 k (0.5 % risk)	≈ 29 k USDT	≈ 19 k USDT
95 % worst 30‑day drawdown (Monte‑Carlo)	‑8 R (‑4 % equity)	‑4.5 R (‑2.2 % equity)
Net PF after fees	1.55 – 1.7	1.35 – 1.45
Correlation drag	Managed by skip‑rule ρ > 0.8	Near‑zero beta portfolio on crash candles
Funding & fee load	3 fee legs; ~1.2 bp / trade	2–3 legs, but hedge often earns funding (short alts)
Latency sensitivity	Medium (independent fills)	High: hedge legs must fill ≤ 50 ms after BTC
Operational complexity	Already coded (direction breaker, risk throttle)	Adds β calculator, pair netting engine, VaR monitor
Capital scalability	Good up to Binance size tier; watch alt liquidity > 5 M USDT	Excellent — gross notional high, net exposure capped

Correlation note: 30‑day BTC–ETH and BTC–SOL correlations typically hover 0.7–0.85, but can compress toward 1.0 in panic moves
