Here's a clear, detailed step-by-step explanation of how your BTC-alpha + Dynamic ETH/SOL Hedge Strategy works from TradingView alert through to FastAPI/WebSocket order execution on Binance Futures, including position sizing and AI-SuperTrend trailing stop management:
üö© Step 1: TradingView Alert Received

When your configured LuxAlgo composite alert triggers in TradingView, it sends a webhook (JSON payload) instantly to your FastAPI backend:

{
  "symbol": "BINANCE:BTCUSDT",
  "side": "BUY",
  "qty": "{{calc_position_size}}",
  "sl": "{{strategy.order.price - atr14*0.75}}",
  "tp1": "{{strategy.order.price + risk}}",
  "trail": "AI_SUPERTREND"
}

üåê Step 2: FastAPI Backend Processing

Your FastAPI endpoint (/webhook) receives the webhook payload:

@app.post("/webhook")
async def webhook_trade(payload: AlertPayload):
    # Parse alert JSON payload
    symbol = payload.symbol
    side = payload.side
    entry_price = fetch_current_price(symbol)  # from Binance API
    sl = payload.sl
    tp1 = payload.tp1
    trail_method = payload.trail

    # Confirm valid conditions (optional re-checks)
    if not is_market_condition_stable(symbol):
        return {"status": "trade skipped due to volatility"}

    # Calculate position size
    equity = fetch_account_equity()
    position_size_usdt = calculate_position_size(equity, entry_price, sl)

    # Place primary order on Binance Futures
    order_response = await place_order(symbol, side, position_size_usdt, entry_price, sl, tp1, trail_method)

    return {"status": "trade placed", "details": order_response}

üìê Step 3: Position Sizing Calculation

The standard formula you use is:
USDT_qty=Account_Equity√óRisk%Entry Price‚àíStop-Loss
USDT_qty=Entry Price‚àíStop-LossAccount_Equity√óRisk%‚Äã
üîπ Example (LONG BTCUSDT):

    Risk per trade: 0.75%

    Entry Price: $85,000

    SL: $84,600

    Risk: $400 per BTC

üëâ For $1,000 equity:

USDT_qty = (1000 √ó 0.0075) / (400) 
         = 7.5 / 400
         = 0.01875 BTC

Notional Position = 0.01875 BTC √ó $85,000 ‚âà $1,593.75 (20√ó leverage covered)

üëâ For $50,000 equity:

USDT_qty = (50000 √ó 0.0075) / (400)
         = 375 / 400
         = 0.9375 BTC

Notional Position = 0.9375 BTC √ó $85,000 ‚âà $79,687.50 (comfortably within 20√ó leverage limits)

üìå Step 4: Binance Order Execution via WebSocket/API

Your FastAPI calls Binance Futures API asynchronously (for minimal latency):

async def place_order(symbol, side, qty, entry, sl, tp1, trail):
    order = await binance_client.futures_create_order(
        symbol=symbol,
        side=side,
        type='MARKET',
        quantity=round(qty, 5),
    )

    # Set SL and TP immediately after market order execution
    sl_order = await binance_client.futures_create_order(
        symbol=symbol,
        side='SELL' if side == 'BUY' else 'BUY',
        type='STOP_MARKET',
        stopPrice=sl,
        closePosition=True
    )

    tp_order = await binance_client.futures_create_order(
        symbol=symbol,
        side='SELL' if side == 'BUY' else 'BUY',
        type='LIMIT',
        price=tp1,
        quantity=round(qty * 0.3, 5),  # First TP at 30%
        reduceOnly=True
    )

    # Remaining position is managed by AI_SUPERTREND (see below)

    return {
        "entry_order": order,
        "sl_order": sl_order,
        "tp1_order": tp_order
    }

ü§ñ Step 5: AI_SUPERTREND Trailing (Dynamic Exit Management)

AI_SUPERTREND trailing intelligently adjusts trailing stop-losses based on market volatility and trend strength in real-time:

    Initially, you have a fixed SL.

    After TP-1 hits, move SL to break-even (BE).

    Remaining 70% position is managed dynamically via AI_SUPERTREND.

Example:

    You entered BTC long at $85,000.

    Price hits TP-1 at $85,400 (+1R), close 30%.

    Remaining position SL moved to entry (85,000).

    AI_SUPERTREND calculates trailing stops using volatility (ATR-based clusters). E.g.:

Time	BTC Price	AI-SuperTrend SL
Entry	85,000	84,600 (initial)
TP-1 hit	85,400	85,000 (BE)
+30 min	85,700	85,400
+60 min	85,850	85,600
+90 min	85,950	85,800

    As price rises, SL trails upward. When price pulls back below the dynamic SL, the remaining 70% position exits automatically.

üìâ Step 6: Dynamic ETH/SOL Hedging

Your BTC positions are dynamically hedged by shorts in ETH and SOL, sized by rolling Œ≤ (Beta):

    If BTC long entry size = 0.5 BTC,

    ETH hedge = (0.5 BTC √ó Œ≤_ETH), SOL hedge = (0.5 BTC √ó Œ≤_SOL).

Hedging Example:

    Œ≤_ETH ‚âà 0.85, ETH hedge short = 0.425 ETH

    Œ≤_SOL ‚âà 0.65, SOL hedge short = 0.325 SOL

ETH/SOL hedges placed simultaneously via similar FastAPI/Binance API calls.
üõ° Step 7: Risk Controls & Circuit Breaker

    Daily circuit-breaker: Stops after cumulative daily loss reaches -3R.

    Equity trailing stop: Pause trading if equity drops below -6% from recent highs.

    Latency Guard: Reduces leverage from 20√ó ‚Üí 5√ó temporarily if median latency exceeds ~350ms.
